Privacy-First Budget Tracker
A simple, open-source finance tracker focused on privacy, clarity, and full user control
Overview

Most budget tracking apps today suffer from the same problems: essential features locked behind paid plans, mandatory bank account integrations, and a lack of transparency about how user data is stored and used.

This project was created to solve those issues with a simple, private, and fully local approach to personal finance management.

Motivation

I wanted a tool that allowed me to organize my household finances without giving control of my financial data to third parties.

The main problems I wanted to avoid were:

Paid plans blocking basic and essential features

Mandatory bank integrations that collect sensitive financial data

Privacy risks caused by centralized databases and potential data breaches

Confusing financial analysis when moving money between multiple accounts

Instead of adapting to existing tools, I decided to build something simpler and more transparent.

What This App Does

The goal of this app is straightforward:

Track income and expenses manually, with full control

Manage recurring bills and payments

Calculate and visualize monthly tax payments

Keep a home inventory and shopping list

In Brazil, taxes are a significant part of daily expenses, but people often don’t know the exact amount they pay. This app helps make that information clearer.

Key Principles

This project follows a few core principles:

Privacy-first: No bank connections, no data tracking, no third-party services

No external databases: All data is stored locally

Portability: Your account can be transferred between devices by copying a simple code

Simplicity: Basic, intuitive, and focused on real needs

Open source: Anyone can inspect, modify, and improve the code

What This App Is (and Isn’t)

✔ A simple and practical tool to help people control their finances
✔ Designed to reduce confusion and support debt management
✔ Built with real-life use cases in mind

✖ Not a financial institution
✖ Not an automated bank tracker
✖ Not intended to be a revolutionary product

The goal is clarity, not complexity.
